Bridging in DeFi is like connecting two different blockchains to allow assets to move between them. It's like building a bridge between two islands to enable people to travel back and forth.

Suppose our guy Bob holds some USDC on Base but wants to use them transact on Polygon, a different L2. To do this, he uses a bridge service that locks his USDC on the Base and mints equivalent tokens on the Polygon. This bridge simplifies the transfer of tokens between the two chains.
